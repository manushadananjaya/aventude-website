          <p>
            When an enterprise expands, so does the complexity and volume of
            data driving its day-to-day operations. Legacy systems such as SQL
            Server Management Studio (SSMS) and Reporting Services (SSRS)
            struggle to keep pace with increasing demands as businesses scale
            rapidly. This was the challenge faced by The Princeton Review.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Princeton Review (TPR), headquartered in New York, is a leading
            education services provider in the United States. For over four
            decades, it has helped millions of students prepare for high-stakes
            standardised exams through expert tutoring, test preparation, and
            admissions resources. Student enrolments, instructor schedules,
            revenue metrics, and customer insights all depended on timely
            reporting.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, TPR’s legacy infrastructure lacked the agility to meet
            evolving demands. Reliance on SSMS and SSRS led to report response
            time exceeding 20–30 minutes on average, which delayed
            decision-making and negatively impacted user satisfaction. That’s
            when they turned to Aventude.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aventude Data team along with TPR stakeholders rebuilt the data
            architecture end-to-end, adopting Snowflakes, and shifting reporting
            to Power BI. Along the way, the team implemented automated data
            quality checks, Gen AI driven data validation capabiltiies built
            dynamic pipelines, real time auto healing with step up workfows.and
            visualized platformusage analytics to help TPR optimize costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result? A futureready platform that is faster, smarter, and
            measurably more efficient.

        <h3>Speed as a strategic advantage</h3>
        <p>
          Reports generated through SSRS were routinely slow. For delaying
          decision making for teams managing revenue, enrolment, and operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using automated ETL pipelines running on orchestrated hourly and daily
          schedules, the team migrated more than 400 tables from multiple
          sources, including SQL Servers and Salesforce. Power BI became the
          primary visualization layer, connecting directly to Snowflake for
          real-time insights. A dedicated testing pipeline ensured accuracy,
          comparing data between source and destination, automatically flagging
          mismatches. When issues arise, for instance, schema changes, the
          process rolls back, alerts engineers, and reruns after corrections.
          This prevents bad data from reaching the users.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, reports that previously took over half an hour to render,
          now load in under one minute. Teams can check KPIs and align on
          insights in real time.

          <h3>Unlocking predictive analytics based on machine learning</h3>
          <p>
            By migrating to Snowflake team also able to avail itself to the new
            functionalities that Snowflake offers as a data platform such as
            building predictive models to forecast revenue, new students
            signups, course demands, and course utilisation per student.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond core operational data, we integrated additional sources such
            as Dialpad callcentre interactions via APIs. Combining these with
            enrolment and performance data gives TPR a more holistic view of the
            student journey, from first contact to course selection, course
            attendance, learning management, mock exams, and final outcomes.
            This enables smarter marketing, better resource planning, and
            improved student support interventions.
          </p>
          <p>
            To accelerate iteration and scalability, Aventude built dynamic,
            metadata driven procedures so new tables can be onboarded with
            minimal effort: provide schema, table name, and an identifier, and
            the pipeline generates the destination structures, loads data, and
            runs integrity checks automatically. This flexibility of the design
            minimises manual overhead, speed up the delivery, and keeps the
            platform agile as the organisation’s needs evolve.

          <h3>Efficiency and cost optimisation through smart monitoring</h3>
          <p>
            By using both Snowflake and Power BI, TPR is also able to view
            platform usage analytics, such as computing demand, refresh
            frequency, dataset sizes, and user activity.<br /><br />
            By extracting admin and workspace statistics, The Princeton Review
            team can see which Power BI dashboards are most frequently used, how
            often datasets refresh, and where premium capacity is being
            consumed. These analytics helps team prioritize optimization efforts
            and govern platform growth more effectively.<br />
            <br />
            Similarly, by leveraging Snowflake’s native usage data, the team was
            able to monitor warehouse utilization, credit consumption by
            workload, and the cost footprint of specific pipelines or
            procedures. This level of detail helped identify areas where
            resources were being underused and fine-tune resource
            allocation.​<br /><br />
            This allows TPR to optimize its computing resource usage, scale with
            confidence, and maximize their efficiency.<br />
            <br />​ Aventude data team helped transform a major performance
            challenge into a strategic advantage. By moving to Snowflake,
            implementing Power BI, and introducing quality, cost controls, and
            platform observability, the team reduced report load times to under
            a minute, unlocked predictive analytics, and gained tighter cost
            oversight.​
