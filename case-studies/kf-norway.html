            Organizations are often ready to invest heavily in digital
            transformation and modernization to create advanced, user-friendly
            platforms; but transitioning the existing forms, content and
            processes to the new platform can often create so severe a
            bottleneck that it calls into question the financial viability of
            the transition.
          </p>
          <p>
            KF.no (Kommuneforlaget) is a leading Norwegian technology and
            publishing provider that delivers digital solutions, tools, and
            platforms to support municipalities across Norway. Serving over 300
            municipalities, KF.no plays a critical role in enabling local
            governments to streamline their processes, manage citizen
            interactions, and conduct large-scale surveys and consultations.
            With a focus on user-friendly digital services, compliance, and
            efficiency, KF.no helps public sector organizations modernize and
            improve the way they deliver value to citizens.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was the situation facing KF.no. A technology provider that runs
            the platform over 300 Norwegian municipalities use in conducting
            citizen surveys. These surveys are complex: varied in format,
            multi-language, multi-page and featuring complex branching
            conditional criteria.

        />

        <h3>Transitioning to a Low-Code Platform</h3>
        <p>
          KF.no adopted a cutting-edge Low-Code platform, Compose Glow, for
          their new system, which allows for the creation of highly complex
          interactive surveys easily using a sleek drag and drop interface,
          enables intelligent workflows and features built in data analysis
          tools. It also provides a better experience for the audience taking
          the survey, with a more modern UX and better usability features.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bottle neck however, is moving the hundreds of highly complex
          existing surveys created in PDF, XML and HTML formats. Manually
          migrating the old surveys to new platform which has its own
          proprietary format is a task so complex and time consuming, it would
          have taken over half a year and perhaps proved to be financially
          infeasible.

          <h3>Accelerating The Transition Using an Agentic-Human Loop</h3>
          <p>
            As a solution, Aventude proposed an Agentic-Human Loop, creating a
            double cycle where the AI migrated the Survey in its base form, its
            work was checked by KF's consultants, and then a Low Code, Compose
            Glow version was created by the Gen AI as well, to be checked by a
            testing automation AI agent before proceeding to a final human
            check.

        <p>
          Here is a detailed breakdown of how the five-step agent-human process
          was implemented.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Extraction Agent</strong> – This agent is given the XML and PDFs to extract
            the forms definitions, validation parameters, translative parameters,
            etc. The validations have if-else conditions based on the survey
            answer. This is translated to the show-hide logic and other JavaScript
            logics in the new platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Error Correction and Tool Calling</strong> – When the extract agent cannot
            scan or interpret the logic it makes a tool calling which alerts a
            human to the exact section where the agent failed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>New Platform Agent</strong> – This is agent takes the curated definitions
            and transforms them into new platform definitions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>An Automation Agent powered by Browser Use</strong> – runs all the
            combinations of the answers, checking all the possibilities of the
            workflow and delivers the final verdict on the migration.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>At the very last step</strong> an experienced human consultant will validate
            the overall migration process, checking the language and different
            flows.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reaping the Commercial Benefits</h3>
        <p>
          This method cut down the migration time and effort by more than 70%
          making the transition financially easy on KF.no. Coupled with the
          quicker adoption of the new platform; born from reducing the time it
          takes to deploy and use it to its fullest extent, brings added
          commercial benefits to the client; enabling them to reap the rewards
          of their investment sooner, and fast track their digital
          transformation process.
