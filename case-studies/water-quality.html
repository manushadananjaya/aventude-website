            Managing national water and wastewater systems requires absolute
            trust in data. For Norsk Vann, Norway's national interest
            organization for the water sector, ensuring accurate, standardized
            reporting across hundreds of municipalities and facilities is
            critical to safeguarding water quality and meeting strict legal and
            environmental standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            To modernize its national reporting capabilities and support the
            growing complexity of the sector, Norsk Vann partnered with Aventude
            and the Compose Enterprise team to build a scalable, user-centric
            reporting platform capable of turning complex operational data into
            trusted national insight.

        <h3>A National Challenge Rooted in Complexity</h3>
        <p>
          Norsk Vann manages reporting for a highly distributed infrastructure
          consisting of hundreds of facilities, multiple inter-municipal
          organizations, and diverse operational models. Each year, the
          organization collects and analyzes more than 100,000 data points,
          covering water quality, wastewater performance, costs, compliance, and
          sustainability metrics.
        </p>
        <p>
          While existing systems had served their purpose, they increasingly
          struggled to scale with rising analytical demands. Complex reporting
          structures, manual processes, and rigid data models made it difficult
          to ensure consistency, accuracy, and transparency across the sector.
        </p>
        <p>
          To continue assuring water quality at a national level, Norsk Vann
          required a modern, flexible platform capable of handling analytical
          complexity without increasing the reporting burden on municipalities.

          <h3>A Modern Platform Built for National Assurance</h3>
          <p>
            Compose Enterprise consultancy team with Aventude Engineering team
            collaborated closely with Norsk Vann to modernize the national
            reporting platform, resulting in BedreVANN 3.0 — a future-proof
            solution built using:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Compose Enterprise</li>
            <li>Compose Case Management (CCM)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            By leveraging low-code technology, the team was able to rapidly
            design and deliver a system that mirrors the real-world structure of
            Norway's water sector while simplifying data collection and
            validation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The solution introduced structured workflows, embedded standards,
            and intelligent validation mechanisms that ensure data quality from
            the moment it is entered.

          <h3>Turning Data into Confidence and Trust</h3>
          <p>
            BedreVANN 3.0 enables Norsk Vann and participating organizations to
            confidently manage and evaluate national water data through:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Standardized and validated data entry, reducing errors and
              inconsistencies
            </li>
            <li>
              Performance evaluation aligned with legal and industry standards
            </li>
            <li>
              Clear attribution of quality, costs, and outcomes across
              municipalities
            </li>
            <li>Circularity tracking supporting sustainability goals</li>
            <li>

              improvement
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            By embedding trust directly into the reporting process, the platform
            transforms raw operational data into reliable insight that
            decision-makers can act upon with confidence.
