            For over 30 years, Vetera GmbH, a leading veterinary practice
            management software provider, has supported veterinary clinics
            across Germany with digital solutions for patient management,
            billing, scheduling, and compliance. Vetera's Practice Management
            Software (vetPMS) holds over 90% market share, making it an integral
            part of Germany's veterinary healthcare infrastructure and
            streamlining clinic operations across the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, as its legacy system began to limit growth and innovation,
            Vetera faced a critical challenge: how to modernise without
            disrupting the daily operations of thousands of clinics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aventude stepped in to lead a seamless codebase takeover and
            transformation, ushering in a new era of agility, scalability, and
            data-driven possibilities for the German veterinary services market.

        <h3>Limitations of Vetera's legacy system</h3>
        <p>
          Vetera's PMS had served the company well for 16 years, but its aging
          architecture built on multiple programming languages, UI stacks, and
          custom hardware, was becoming increasingly fragile. The system was
          difficult to maintain, expensive to scale, and slow to adapt to
          evolving market needs. Onboarding new customers took up to a month, a
          bottleneck that forced Vetera to turn away potential clients despite
          growing demand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Windows-based platform also lacked flexibility. It couldn't
          support remote access for veterinarians working in the field or
          traveling between clinics. Integration with modern diagnostic devices
          such as CT scanners, MRI machines, and blood analysis tools was
          cumbersome, limiting the system's utility in a data-rich clinical
          environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most critically, the monolithic design stifled innovation. Vetera
          couldn't explore new revenue models or partnerships, such as sharing
          anonymised clinical data with universities for research into disease
          patterns and treatment outcomes. Because the system was on-premise,
          valuable data remained siloed within individual clinics, inaccessible
          to Vetera and external collaborators. The lack of a modern user
          experience coupled with complex customisation and training
          requirements, made the platform increasingly uncompetitive.

          <h3>Maintaining continuity while preparing for transformation</h3>
          <p>
            Aventude's engagement began with a high-stakes mandate: take over
            the entire legacy codebase with immediate effect while ensuring zero
            disruption to Vetera's operations across its vast customer base. The
            team executed a cut-over and stabilisation strategy, maintaining the
            existing system while laying the groundwork for transformation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through collaborative workshops, Aventude worked closely with
            Vetera's leadership to understand the real pain points and business
            goals. The modernisation plan included migrating the backend to .NET
            Core, introducing HTTP-based communication for modularity, and
            designing Vetera Sky, a cloud-native SaaS platform using Azure PaaS,
            Cosmos DB, React, and Docker.
          </p>
          <p>
            This dual-track approach allowed Aventude to support the legacy
            system while building the new one in parallel. An IoT Hub was
            integrated to synchronise data between desktop clients and the
            cloud, enabling both systems to operate side by side, ensuring
            continuity for existing users while preparing the platform for
            future scalability.

          <h3>Faster onboarding, scalable growth, and new opportunities</h3>
          <p>
            The impact of Aventude's intervention was swift and significant.
            Within 16 months, the first modernised modules of Vetera Sky were
            live, dramatically reducing onboarding time and improving user
            experience. The new system offered plug-and-play usability, seamless
            integration with clinic ecosystems, and remote accessibility,
            empowering veterinarians to work from anywhere, whether in rural
            areas or on the move.
          </p>
          <p>
            By shifting to a cloud-first architecture, Vetera unlocked new
            business models. The platform could now support data-sharing
            partnerships with universities and research institutions, enabling
            studies into disease spread, treatment efficacy, and regional health
            trends. This not only added value to the veterinary community but
            also positioned Vetera as a data-driven innovator in healthcare
            technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            The modernisation also allowed Vetera to evolve its business model,
            moving beyond traditional licensing to offer scalable SaaS
            solutions. Clinics could now subscribe to services based on usage,
            enabling more flexible pricing and faster deployment. The system's
            modular design also made it easier to roll out new features and
            integrations, keeping pace with technological advancements and
            customer expectations.
