          Providing Understanding in Times of Crisis: How Aventude worked with

          Aventude & Transvoice built a future-ready interpretation platform
          together that transformed the way they did business, with greater
          flexibility of service, offering built-in intelligence and
          inclusivity.

            In high-stakes environments such as healthcare, justice, and social
            services, effective communication is the foundation of timely
            action. Transvoice, Sweden's leading provider of interpretation and
            language services, plays an essential role in this by managing and
            delivering thousands of interpreters every day to government
            agencies, municipalities, courts, healthcare providers, and private
            organisations across the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite its significant success, Transvoice's platform was based on
            older technology that couldn't be innovated easily, a weakness that
            made responding to the pandemic a greater challenge. Working
            together with Aventude, they were not only able to modernize their
            platform to tackle the challenges the Pandemic posed but make it
            significantly more agile and future ready and able to quickly
            respond to changes in the market.

        <h3>Evolving Transvoice's service offering to face the pandemic</h3>
        <p>
          Before 2020, almost all of Transvoice's interpreter services were
          physical, in-person appointments. But the COVID-19 Pandemic created an
          urgent need for hospitals, government offices, and other institutions
          to avail themselves of interpretation services remotely.
        </p>
        <p>
          This prompted Transvoice to consider the engineering of its platform,
          and its need for modernization so that it could innovate in an agile
          fashion, add new features easily and offer its services in a variety
          of formats. As a result, what started as a pandemic necessity became a
          core development. Clients can now choose between physical
          appointments, video calls, or phone sessions, booking the ideal
          service based on their needs and preferences. This flexibility has
          been particularly valuable in healthcare, where urgent consultations
          often require immediate language support.

            Automatic filters, load management, and insights create a smarter
            experience
          </h3>
          <p>
            The modernization of Transvoice's platform has also allowed for a
            smarter, more personalized experience. For example, if customers
            need a female interpreter for cultural sensitivity, they can add
            that filter, and in cases such as healthcare where interpreters need
            to hold the right certifications, the appropriate candidates are
            filtered automatically, eliminating manual checks, saving time and
            reducing errors.
          </p>
          <p>
            The modernized platform also provides insights and analytics that
            allow interpreters, customers and end users to plan better and ahead
            of time. This allows everyone to understand what types of
            interpreters are most in demand (which language, gender or domain
            speciality), which days of the week have higher demand, rescheduling
            suggestions that can be made to better handle high demand periods,
            and critically important appointments which can be automatically
            prioritised, providing for greater efficiency for all parties
            involved.

          <h3>Improving the interpreter experience</h3>
          <p>
            Game-changing improvements were also made to the interpreter portal.
            Interpreters are now able to manage their calendar, block out leave,
            specify leave type, and set their availability with precision. This
            not only improves work-life balance but also ensures they can
            optimize their time efficiently. Interpreters can even specify the
            types of assignments they prefer, creating opportunities for them to
            do their best work, and enjoy greater work satisfaction.

      <section class="case-study-section">
        <h3>Efficiency, inclusivity, and societal change</h3>
        <p>
          The results speak for themselves. Interpreter bookings now take less
          than 10 seconds, with 4,000 active users and 5,000 assignments
          processed daily. Interpreter utilisation rate has surged, driven by
          smarter scheduling and predictive demand forecasting.
        </p>
        <p>
          For users, the benefits go beyond convenience. The ability to select
          interaction modes and interpreter attributes such as gender or
          certification has enhanced user satisfaction, improved cultural
          sensitivity, and made the service more inclusive and responsive to
          individual needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          But perhaps the most profound impact is societal. It's not just about
          technology; it's about equity, dignity, and human connection. By
          removing language barriers in critical areas like healthcare and
          public services, Transvoice and Aventude have advanced the cause of
          inclusivity. In a country welcoming diverse linguistic community, this
          transformation ensures that no one is left unheard.
