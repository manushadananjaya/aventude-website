            The Princeton Review (TPR) is a leading education services
            enterprise in the USA providing tutoring, test preparation and
            admission resources for millions of students. Headquartered in New
            York, it specializes in test preparation, tutoring, and admissions
            services for standardized exams such as the SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT,
            LSAT, and MCAT. As a company that has been in business for over 40
            years, they are always expanding the technical capabilities of their
            products and initially connected with Aventude while on the lookout
            for external software engineering teams to help boost their
            development capabilities.  
          </p>
          <p>
            But what started out as a limited engagement with Aventude to build
            out the front-end dashboards for one of their client’s applications,
            soon turned into a long-term growth partnership once TPR experienced
            Aventude’s passion for technology, solution driven mindset and
            flexibility. Through this partnership, the client successfully
            delivered several high-impact applications to the business.

            "Partnering with Aventude has been an outstanding experience. Their
            team consistently demonstrated professionalism across all aspects of
            our day-to-day work. The ability to seamlessly scale resources up or
            down across multiple engagements made delivery efficient and
            stress-free. Onboarding was smooth, and the strong support from
            Aventude's PMO and CTO office ensured alignment, governance, and
            continuity throughout every initiative we undertook together."

          <p>
            Aventude's broad range of technical capabilities meant they were
            able help TPR scale their operations across multiple areas,
            including backend development, UX design, data engineering and
            machine learning, and DevOps, adding measurable value across all
            aspects of their business.

          <p>
            But it was really the way that Aventude closely collaborated with
            the client, understanding their needs and technology stack, and
            providing not only highly skilled engineers but also
            solution-oriented professionals who think about solving business
            problems first, that led Aventude to become a trusted long-term
            partner.

          <p>
            Aventude's flexibility to scale up or down on short notice and its
            agile, collaborative approach allowed TPR to adjust the pace at
            which it was growing throughout the partnership. When TPR was
            looking to launch new products or features or innovate their
            platforms, they could scale their team up with Aventude in order to
            accelerate that work. But when the project loads decreased, they
            could so scale down the teams and reduce costs. This eliminated the
            risks involved in making the investment to speed up their
            engineering, as well as reduce the time to scale.

        <h3>Aventude also made collaborating day-to-day seamless</h3>
        <p>
          With a hybrid delivery model that saw business and product managers
          onsite in the U.S. working seamlessly with engineering teams in Sri
          Lanka, Aventude was able to make the experience of working with an
          offsite team smooth. Time zone differences were addressed by aligning
          the teams based in Sri Lanka to U.S. client hours, ensuring real-time
          collaboration. Aventude also offered project management support, and
          introduced and co-implementing best practices that strengthened
          delivery and improved implementation success.
