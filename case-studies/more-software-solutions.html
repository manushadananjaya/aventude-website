            More Software Solutions, in partnership with KF.no—prominent
            providers of survey platforms for the public sector in
            Norway—specialize in creating surveys tailored for various Norwegian
            municipalities. These surveys cover a wide range of topics,
            including employee satisfaction, as well as user satisfaction with
            public services such as water supply, kindergartens, and schools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their once-robust platform, built on the BK system in 2003, had
            grown outdated and posed significant hurdles to the company’s
            current operations and future growth prospects due to its monolithic
            architecture and use of aging technologies. The system’s inherent
            limitations hindered user satisfaction and impeded the
            implementation of essential updates and improvements, leading to the
            accumulation of technical debt.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to remain competitive and continue evolving with user
            expectations, the system needed to be transformed and modernized,
            but the lengthy and resource-intensive process of rewriting the
            system posed time constraints, frustrated stakeholders, and impeded
            the company’s agility in responding to market demands. Moreover, the
            system’s lack of scalability inhibited the company’s ability to
            explore new revenue models and penetrate new markets, while
            competitors leveraging modern platforms threatened the company’s
            market share.
          </p>
          <p>
            These problems were compounded by challenges in integrating the old
            BK system with third-party systems, creating inconsistencies in
            functionality and user interface that impacted usability and
            adoption. Additionally, the task of migrating over 20 years of
            accumulated data presented a complex and time-consuming obstacle,
            necessitating careful planning to ensure data integrity and minimize
            disruptions.

          Aventude and More Software Solutions leveraged their agility and
          creativity to modernize the platform painlessly.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Recognizing the inherent time constraints associated with a complete
          system rewrite, a parallel system-architecture approach was devised.
          This innovative strategy allowed for the gradual introduction of new
          modules and features while maintaining the functionality of the legacy
          system. Consequently, users experienced an evolving user experience
          (UX) without significant downtime or operational disruptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this way, Aventude collaborated with business stakeholders from
          Norway, co-creating a modern, cloud-based microservice architecture
          with enhanced usability. To address the challenge of data migration
          from the old system to the new one, robust data-migration strategies
          were implemented. By leveraging analytical dashboards, the team
          achieved seamless data migration while upholding data integrity and
          accuracy. This meticulous approach facilitated the transition of data,
          granting users access to historical data and insights within the new
          platform, thereby ensuring continuity of operations and user
          satisfaction.

          <p>
            To facilitate seamless integration with third-party systems and
            maintain a consistent user experience, module federation was
            implemented. This approach enabled the incorporation of
