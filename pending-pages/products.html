            <h1>Accelerating <span>Your Product Journey</span></h1>
            <p>
              We're building platforms and products that help customers move
              faster from idea to impact. By leveraging reusable frameworks,
              automation, and pre-built components, we shorten development
              cycles and eliminate repetitive bottlenecks. Our goal is to let
              teams focus on innovation and user value rather than
              re-engineering everything from scratch. Each platform or product
              can be used under an RTL license, with all integrations pre-agreed
              and fully transparent to customers — ensuring speed, clarity, and
              trust in every engagement.

            <h2>Citrus 65</h2>
            <p>
              Citrus 65 is Aventude's internal acceleration framework built
              especially for startups and product MVP development. It scaffolds
              both the frontend and backend, providing a ready-made foundation
              that helps teams move from concept to prototype with speed and
              confidence. Beyond new builds, Citrus 65 also enables engineers to
              understand and extend existing codebases faster, reducing
              onboarding and refactoring time. Its flexible design lets
              developers plug into any architecture — microservices, monoliths,
              or cloud-native — ensuring freedom without compromising structure.
              With Citrus 65, startups can focus on innovation while
              accelerating time to market.

              everyday questions into meaningful reports and visualizations,
              QueryOn helps teams make faster, data-driven decisions and brings
              true self-service intelligence to business users.
